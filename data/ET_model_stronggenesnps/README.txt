The files in this model were downloaded from /project/mstephens/gtex/analysis/june2014/types_v1/et_all_stats_trainedonnull and represent the posterior means, lfsr and lfdrs of the strongest gene-snp pairs across 16,407 gene snp pairs. This is the model which produces the highest likelihood of the test set so far, where the procedure for choosing a model consists of 'training the model" on a selection of the first batch and testing it on the remander. This allows for shrinkage because the vast majority of gene snp pairs in 'first batch' represent noise. This produced a test likelihood that was 383941.85449 when compared with the best EE model which was 381418.053939646. 

The list of covariance matrices, also included, included the Identity matrix, the RxR empirical covariance matrix, 5 SFA single rank approximations, Rank2 PC approximation, a 5 rank SFA approximation and 44+1 singleton and shared configuration matrix. We choose a grid of 22 elements (mult=sqrt(2)).
