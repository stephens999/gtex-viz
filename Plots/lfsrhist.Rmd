```{r}
pathdir=("../data/ET_model_stronggenesnps/")
lfsr = read.table(paste0(pathdir,"lfsr.et_withbma.txt"))
```

Now plot a histogram of the number of tissues with lfsr $\leq$thresh.

```{r}
lfindex=apply(lfsr,1,function(x){sum(x<=0.10)})
hist(lfindex,main="Number of tissues in which eQTL is significant at LFSR of 0.10",xlab="Number of Tissues",ylab="Density",freq=FALSE,nclass=40)
```
