Here, I find the number of QTLs that are specific to a particular tissues, as defined by the fact that they have only one tissue in which their LFSR satisfies a particular threshold.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
dirpath=("../data/ET_model_stronggenesnps/")
lfsr = read.table(paste0(dirpath,"lfsr.et_withbma.txt"))
tissue.names=colnames(lfsr)



inputPanel(
  selectInput("n_thresh", label = "Threshold:",
              choices = c(0.05,0.10,0.5), selected = 0.05)
)




renderPlot({
thresh=as.numeric(input$n_thresh)
  
  ##create a matrix showing whether or no lfsr satisfies threshold


    sigmat=(lfsr<=thresh)



#pull out snps only significant in 1
sigs=which(rowSums(sigmat)==1)

##find significant tissues
sigmat[sigs,]

numberqtls=apply(sigmat[sigs,],2,sum)

barplot(numberqtls,names=tissue.names,las=2,main="Number Tissue Specific QTLS per Tissue")

})




```
