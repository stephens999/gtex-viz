As mentioned, I can't get a 'non-blue' plot with heatmap 2, so you can use heatmap2 to get the scale and make the qualitative plots with heatmap. Here I plot a heatmap of the matrix-ash shrunken t stats and non0shrunken t stats. You could also make a heatamp with the

```{r}
pathdir=("../data/ET_model_stronggenesnps/")
postmeans = read.table(paste0(pathdir,"post.mean.et_withbma.txt"))
tstats=na.omit(read.table(paste0(pathdir,"max_tscore_eQTL.table.txt")))[,-c(1,2,47)]

tissue.names=colnames(postmeans)

row.names(postmeans) <- seq(1, nrow(postmeans),1)

#library("gplots") I can't get a 'non-blue' plot with heatmap 2, so you can use heatmap2 to get the scale and make the qualitative plots with heatmap
heatmap(t(postmeans),main="ShrunkenTStatistics",labRow=tissue.names)

heatmap(t(tstats),labRow=tissue.names,main="T.stat")
```
